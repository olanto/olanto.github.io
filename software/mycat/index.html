<p>myCAT is a concordancer, i.e. a full-text search engine which, in addition to showing the relevant documents, also shows their translation (if they were previously translated) and automatically aligns the source and target language versions on the occurrences of the terms which is being searched.</p>

<p>myCAT includes two modules:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Text Aligner</li>
<li>a Quote Detector</li>
</ul>

<p>The Text Aligner displays and automatically aligns the source language and the target language versions of a given document.</p>

<p>The Quote Detector compares a document to be translated with the complete corpus of previously-translated documents and detects all parts of sentences (or full sentences or paragraphs) which may be quoted from other documents. It then displays and aligns the source and target versions of that reference document.</p>

<p>What makes myCAT unique is that its automatic alignment feature is based on alignment maps which are built with <a href="https://www.statmt.org/moses/">Moses</a>, a Statistical Machine Translation engine. myCAT can be used in any language combination; if no alignment map was built for a given language pair, a geometrical alignment algorithm will be used by default.</p>

<h2 id="online-demonstration-demo">Online demonstration Demo</h2>

<p>Before using the demo, it is strongly suggested to read the tips below.
The demo is available at: <a href="http://srv3.olanto.org/TranslationText">demo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="interface-language">Interface language !</h3>

<p>We have a dynamic approach to integrate new languages for the Graphical User Interface of myCAT. We have all the interface&rsquo;s components in 5 languages (en, fr, ar, es, ru). If you think that you can add a new language for the interface please contact (link sends e-mail) us and we will guide you for its integration in the tool.</p>

<h3 id="quick-start">Quick Start!</h3>

<p>If you just want to take a quick look at how myCAT works, the simplest way is to test the Text Aligner and the Quote Detector.</p>

<h3 id="read-me-first">Read me first!</h3>

<p>If you would like to test myCAT, here are a few items you should read first:</p>

<p>Supported Browsers: Although myCAT was developed with Google&rsquo;s GWT technology which theoretically enables it to support most browsers, it is strongly advised to use a recent version of Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>An online User Manual is available by clicking on the HELP button; this document details how to use myCAT so it is strongly recommended to read it before testing out the application.</p>

<p>The demo version of myCAT is built on a corpus which includes over a million documents, over 10 million different words indexed and 25 languages. This corpus essentially comes from the following sources: The United Nations&rsquo; <a href="https://www.euromatrixplus.net/multi-un/">Multilingual Parallel Text 2000-2009  </a>and the <a href="https://langtech.jrc.it/JRC-Acquis.html">European Commission&rsquo;s JRC-Acquis</a>.</p>

<h4 id="testing-the-text-aligner">Testing the Text Aligner</h4>

<p>Define your language pair in the scroll-down menus (Ex: EN-FR means English to French). The 2-letter language codes are compliant with the ISO 639-1 standard.</p>

<p>Type any word or expression in your source language (in this example: English) in the text field.</p>

<p>Click on the GO button or hit the ENTER key.</p>

<p>Click on any document in the Hit List. The term which was entered will be highlighted in the relevant document and the target version will be displayed and automatically aligned.</p>

<p>You can navigate from a hit term to the next or previous one by clicking on the &lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt; button.</p>

<p>You can use the vertical scroll bar to navigate within the displayed document. At any time you can double-click a word in that text and then click on the &ldquo;Align&rdquo; button to see the other language version&rsquo;s relevant part of the text.</p>

<p>You can use the &ldquo;Search&rdquo; button to perform a new search in the displayed document (in case it contains a lot of interesting terminology, for example).</p>

<p>The documents displayed in the Text Aligner are a plain text conversion of the original documents (which are typically in MS-Word or PDF format). The &ldquo;Original&rdquo; button normally allows viewing the file in its original format. However in this demo only the documents from the &ldquo;Small Collection&rdquo; can be viewed in their original format. Thus if you want to test the Original button, please first click on the Collection button, choose the &ldquo;Small Collection&rdquo; and click on &ldquo;Set Selection&rdquo;. Thus all the hit documents you will find will come from that collection and will be viewable in original format.</p>

<h4 id="testing-the-quote-detector">Testing the Quote Detector</h4>

<p>Click on the &ldquo;Quote Detector&rdquo; button.</p>

<p>Define your language pair in the scroll-down menus.</p>

<p>Click on the &ldquo;Browse&rdquo; button to upload the document you want to be analyzed. A test document, to be analyzed from English to French, can be downloaded <a href="http://srv3.olanto.org/download/documentation/Test_document.docx">here</a>.
Note: in the demo version the documents to be analyzed by the Quote Detector are truncated after 3&rsquo;000 characters.</p>

<p>Click on the GO button. The resulting analyzed document is displayed in the central frame; statistics on the analysis results are appended at the end of the analyzed document.</p>

<h4 id="version-2-0-date-30-november-2012">Version 2.0 Date: 30 November 2012</h4>

<p>New Features in the Text Aligner</p>

<ul>
<li>Search is now possible on file names.</li>
<li>Navigation by tabs from the Text Aligner to other myCAT modules.</li>
<li>All messages are grouped in a bottom bar which also includes a link to Olanto’s website and a “Feedback” mailto link.</li>

<li>A Self-Quote Detector is now available</li>
</ul>

<p>The Self-Quote Detector is a tool which detects whether some expressions are repeated within a document. If an expression is used several times across the text, it will find it and turn it into a hypertext so the user can navigate from an occurrence of that expression to the next one. This feature is useful if the user wants to see a specific expression in the various contexts in which it is used in the document to be translated, or if the translation must be shared between several translators.</p>

<p>The result of the Self-Quote Detector is an HTML file which can be saved so it can be open and used later in a browser independently from the application.</p>

<h4 id="version-1-1-1-b-date-31-july-2012">Version 1.1.1.b Date: 31 July 2012</h4>

<p>Bug Fixes</p>

**  Adding languages
** Placing the corpus, the index and the alignment maps in a different location from C:\ (which is myCAT&rsquo;s main location).</li>
<li>Thus the source code does not have to be distributed within the application anymore.</li>
<li>The internal folder structure of myCAT was modified accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="version-1-1-1-a-date-16-july-2012">Version 1.1.1.a Date: 16 July 2012</h4>

<ul>
<li>In QD the quote marks were overlapping when two references were immediately following each other in the analyzed text. The GWT code was corrected.</li>
<li>The blue bars indicating the probable location of the relevant text part in QD were sometimes much too long or too short. The GWT code was corrected.</li>
<li>A search for figures separated by commas or dots did not retrieve any result. This was corrected with a generic character which is the blank character: when looking for a number which could be separated by commas, dots or apostrophes, users now simple put a blank space instead of those characters and the string is retrieved whatever the original character. The indexer was corrected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Improvements</p>

<ul>
<li>The underscore character &ldquo;_&rdquo; is now indexed.</li>
</ul>
